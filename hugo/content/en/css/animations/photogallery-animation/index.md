# Small CSS animations series - 06

In these series of exercises you have to replicate a series of elements.

Make an exact copy of the examples and write your own HTML and CSS!

## SPECIAL

This exercise is a little different than the others, Try to make  a little page and style it to your taste. Include this text somewhere on the page (be creative!).

` Lonely commute`

`Join Australia-based photographer Mark Forbes as he wanders the streets of Tokyo with a camera & heart full of curiosity documenting the Lonely Commute.`

Now imagine a small gallery of images where you can hover over and get the animated result at the bottom for each of them.

## Before you start

Please copy and paste this code inside your editor:

```html

<html>
    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Animations - exercise 6</title>
    </head>
<body>

<!-- put your content here -->

</body>

</html>
