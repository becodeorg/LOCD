Colors:

Paste this in your editor:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Flex - exercise 3</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- put your content here -->
</body>
</html>
```

**Tip**: always start with the content: so focus on the html first, without worrying to much about CSS. When your HTML is good, the move on to CSS. This way, you will only add classes when required by the CSS, which is a good practice.
