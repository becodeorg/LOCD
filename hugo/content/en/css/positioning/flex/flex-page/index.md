# Flexing page

For this exercise we will not use any set-up code. We gonna refresh your HTML skills!
What are we going to make?

A landing page about **Tim Berners-Lee**!

Does his name not ring a bell? Don't worry, You will get to know him during this exercise.

## Refreshing

Recreate the following structure in HTML:

{{< bigImage imageid="html-example.png" alt="Html page with out style" >}}

## Flex those containers!

Great work! Now style this page into this:

{{< bigImage imageid="endgoal.png" alt="Eng goal target" >}}

The images required for this exercise are located inside the resources\images folder.

Name of images: 
- alien.jpg
- lesvacances.jpeg
- space-od.jpeg
- tim-berner.jpeg

Try to use flex-box as much as possible!

**Note:** You will not find the correct font, try to use something that gets "close enough".

**Tip**: always start with the content: so focus on the html first, without worrying to much about CSS. When your HTML is _"good"_, move on to CSS. This way, you will only add classes when required by the CSS, which is a good practice.
