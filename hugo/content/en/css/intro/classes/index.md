# Exercise: Use classes to differentiate elements and style them differently

**Instruction**

**Before you start, please copy paste the previous completed exercise in the editor**

Let's make the last exercise look better, using more advanced techniques. Use the CSS Cheat Sheet and the Documentation to find the proper syntax. The wording is made to give a hint at the correct property name).

1. Style the body tag so that it has a padding of 30px and a light grey background color (use these values: Red: 220, Green: 220, Blue: 220)

2. Style all Paragraphs so that their font is 16px, with a line height of 120% , with a dark (but not black) color (use these values: Red: 25, Green: 25, Blue: 25)

3. Add a class to the paragraph tag underneath the H1 tag, with a value of "introduction" (the syntax is like this: `<p class="classname">`and in CSS, you can mention that it is a class by adding a period in front of it, like this  `.classname`  (If you are stuck, make sure to read about "Selectors" in the Documentation or in the lessons)

4. Style that "introduction" paragraph by setting its font size at 140% . Change the line height to 200% and give it an "italic" font style.
