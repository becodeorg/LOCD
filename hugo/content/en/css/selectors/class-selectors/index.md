**Instructions**

Add the necessary classes in the html below. Then style each of the brand names in the html so that they look as close as possible as their brand logo.
Note that you can also add more HTML tags if you want to (especially for FedEx, you will need to!). In such case, use `<span>` tags, they are useful to color a part of a text

Here is the result you should try to reach (or as close as possible).

{{< image imageid="toyota.png" alt="toyota" >}}
{{< image imageid="fedex.png" alt="fedex" >}}
{{< image imageid="facebook.png" alt="facebook" >}}
