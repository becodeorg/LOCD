# Semantic HTML

## Why use semantics
Semantics happens when we attach a specific signification to a sign. We have learned to recognize an arrow as pointing towards a direction - a dog, a cat, does not understand that from looking at the sign below. In fact, it is hard for our brain to look at this sign and not infer its semantic because our brains love it!

{{< image imageid="arrow.png" alt="An arrow" >}}

We use semantics all the time, everywhere around. This helps us navigate our lives in cities for example. We learn conventions (such as the traffic signs) and rely on them to tell us what lies ahead. We see, we know.

In HTML, when we tell that a chunk of text is a Paragraph, the browser then "knows" how to render it in a specific way. For instance, a screen reader software can read the paragraph in a specific tone. This is particularly useful with images for instance. Properly adding syntax to an image tag can make or break the blind person's understanding of the content.

## Semantic HTML

The HTML5 specification includes several semantic elements to help organize documents. Semantic elements are specifically designed to communicate meaning to the browser, developer, reader, and any other technologies interpreting the document (e.g. voice assistants, screen readers, search engines...).

### Section elements introduced in HTML5

Section elements are very useful to group semantically related elements together. According to the MDN documentation (1), there are 4 different elements that you can use to organize and semantically group chunks of html to identify sections of your document:

> - "**HTML Navigation Element** (`<nav>`) useful for navigation links, very frequent on websites. You can have primary and secondary menus, but you can never nest them, or put a second `<nav>` element inside a `<nav>` element.
> - **HTML Article Element** (`<article>`) defines a piece of self-contained content.
> - **HTML Section Element** (`<section>`) defines a section of a document to indicate a related grouping of semantic meaning.
> - **HTML Aside Element** (`<aside>`) defines a section that, though related to the main element, doesn't belong to the main flow, like an explanation box or an advertisement, or a "related products" list, for example. It should not be inside the main one (typically, an `<article>`)."

### Other Semantic HTML elements used in Sectioning

The same Mozilla Contributor advances the following definitions for the elements used in Sectioning:

> - "**HTML Body Element** (`<body>`) defines all the content of a document. It contains all the content and HTML tags.
> - **HTML Header Element** (`<header>`) defines a page which typically contains the logo, title, and navigation. The header can also be used in other semantic elements such as `<article>` or `<section>` â€” or section header, containing perhaps the section's heading, author name, etc. `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<nav>` can have their own `<header>`. Despite its name, it is not necessarily placed at the beginning of the page or section.
> - **HTML Footer Element** (`<footer>`) defines a page footer which typically contains the copyright, legal notices and sometimes some links." This footer can also be used as a section footer, and can contain the section's publication date, license information, etc. `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<nav>` or can have their own `<footer>`. Despite its name, it is not necessarily positioned at the end of the page or section.

### Example layout

The example below is a layout for the body of a blog page. There is a `<header>` with an `<h1>` element and a `<nav>` element that contains the navigation links. The `<header>` is on the same level as the `<section>` and `<footer>` elements. The main `<section>` element has a `<h2>` title, 2 `<article>` and an `<aside>`.

```html
<body>
    <header>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">link</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">link</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">link</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <h1>
        Page Title
      </h1>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>
        My Blog Posts
      </h2>
      <article>
        <header>
          <p>
            Article Title
          </p>
        </header>
        <p>
          content
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <header>
          <p>
            Article Title
          </p>
        </header>
        <p>
          content
        </p>
      </article>
      <aside>
        <p>
          Author info
        </p>
      </aside>
    </section>

    <footer>
      Copyright Info
    </footer>
  </body>
```
