# Exercise 7 - Images

Up until now we have only added different forms of text to your html document. Titles, paragraphs, lists, ...
Most websites nowadays are a little more visually pleasing than the black on white textpage we have right now.
One way to brighten up your website is by adding images. To do this we use the `<img>` html element.
Unlike the previous tags we have used the `<img>` tag does not have an opening and closing tag. It consists of one self-closing tag, written as follows:
`<img/>`
Inside this tag we can add different attributes. The following attributes can be added to an img tag: `src`, `width`, `height`.

`src` attribute: the src, or source, attribute tells the image tag what picture it should display.  
`width` attribute: sets the width of the image.  
`height` attribute: sets the height of the image.  

Try adding the 'funny-goose-sitting-Karen-Arnold.jpg' to this img tag, also fill in the other blank attributes.
