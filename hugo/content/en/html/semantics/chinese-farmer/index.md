# Exercise 3 - Chinese farmer

Translate the html page into semantic html, using the right html tags : `h1`, `h2`, `blockquote`, `q`, `img`, `img`, `hr`, `figure` and `caption`, `table`, `th`, `tr`, `td`, `ul` or `ol` and `li`.

-  [ ] No `div` or `span`: they do not provide any semantics.

- [ ] Find, for each of these tags, the origin of their name (that's how we remember them). If in doubt, look for the answer on the documentation.

- [ ] Add two or three links of your choice in the html page via the tag `a`.

- [ ] Is there a part that could be considered as a header? If so, group it in a `header` tag.

- [ ] And a footer? If so, group this content together in a `footer` tag

- [ ] Put all instances of the words "Maybe" in a `em` or `strong` tag.

- [ ] Add the attribute `Alt` to the images. What is the purpose of this attribute?

- [ ] Add a em tag to the tags surrounding the words "Good" and "Bad" also add a class to the tags named either "*good*" or "*bad*".

- [ ] Find the link attribute to indicate the page to which the link should lead, and add it.

- [ ] Make sure that when you click on the links, the page opens in a new browser tab.

- [ ] Find the attribute to display a small text box when hovering over links, like this:


{{< image imageid="./altatr.jpeg" alt="altatr?" >}}


## Done?

Well done! You just completed the first chapter! But you probably noticed that we still have not made something appealing for the eye.
We will cover that on our next chapter: **CSS**.
